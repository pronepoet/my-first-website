      <p>I love trees. Beautiful aren't they? Makes you just want to tale a deep breath in and then out. Now take a look at <a href="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/Deforestation_in_Tesso_Nilo_Sumatra/story_full_width/1e7g2a63k2_deforestation_causes_HI_104236.jpg">this</a></p>
      <p>The sad reality is that more and more forests are being cut down to make room for agriculture. Our need for food is driving out forests to extiction. But it does not have to be this way. We can find sustainable ways of farming while presrving our forests. We are problem solvers. <em>Plant trees!</em></p>
